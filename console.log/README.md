* Todays work was on making buttons without the simplified version of it, personally i found this one to be alot more complicated as you have to be very specific in what you are linking things together or they really arent going to end up working out in your favour. For my button i had just followed the steps of the linkstony had provided and just did what the main points told me to do but customized it to what colours i wanted and added a fun surpise photo in just for some bonus flare. 
* i found this one to be easier to get going with than the other projects had been when i was doing them this one did seem to cause alot less stress but im unsure if its due to me picking up more or this one just being a bit easier to do. 
* We will see how the next one goes to tell if this one i just knew better or if im starting to get a hang of everything in this course.
